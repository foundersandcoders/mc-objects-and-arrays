# Morning Challenge

## Objects, Arrays and Array methods

Your task is to complete as many of the functions as you can, using the
instructions provided in the comments.

The following is NOT ALLOWED:

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `Array.push`
- The `delete` keyword

Instead, try to use array methods like `.map`, `.filter` and `.reduce`.

The purpose of this challenge is to get used to manipulating data, and also to
get used to using array methods.

To do the challenge, `clone` this repo, and `cd` into it. Go into `index.js`,
read the comments and follow the instructions.

Run `npm test` regularly to ensure your code works.
